# Chatbot-for-SQL-databases
An SQL Chatbot powered by LLM for generating SQL queries and their graphical analysis using natural language questions.


For now, this application works well with **PostgreSQL** and I am working to make sure the other databases are also functional.

**See [Project Link Here](https://chatbot-for-sql-databases.streamlit.app/)**
